# Gesture-Control-Car
This gesture-controlled car project uses two ESP32 boards. The first ESP32 reads tilt data from an MPU6050 sensor and sends directional commands via UDP over Wi-Fi. The second ESP32 receives these commands to control motor speed and direction with PWM, enabling remote car navigation based on real-time sensor inputs.
